# pretty shit chess game
 Attempting to learn C# through building a chess games, hoping it is also going to make me a better chess player


A lot of this has been massivley helped by ChatGPT and YouTube tutorials - 

I have implemented some extra UI features and will expand upon this baseline to include some feature such as:

an AI opponent, 
the ability to play as white or black, 
puzzles and loading game states by FEN notation
